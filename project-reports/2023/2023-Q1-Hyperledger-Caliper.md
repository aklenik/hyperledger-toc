# Overall Activity in the Past Quarter

[List of merged PRs (3)](https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper/pulls?q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-12-08..2023-03-28+)

Summary of activities:
* CI pipeline improvements and fixes
* Planning collaboration with PSWG
* Submitting Caliper-PSWG co-mentored project proposal for the mentorship

# Current Plans

* Overview and decrease the issue backlog.
* Create developer docs that exhaustively document internal Caliper workings.
* Probably shrink the scope of Caliper to highly configurable workload generation and reporting (but less focus on monitoring and SUT managemenent).
* The Ethereum/Besu connector receives increasing attention, but its feature set is limited, it should be enhanced.
* Adjust Caliper capabilities if needed for PSWG-related collaboriation (e.g., easier integration into k8s).
